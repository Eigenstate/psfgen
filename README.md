## Installation

To build and install, you'll need a C compiler:

    python setup.py install

## License

This software is classified as a "derivative work" of the original psfgen
code. It uses the main psfgen code and a swig interface file that are the work
of the original developers (Justin Gullingsrud and Jim Phillips). I have made
it installable, and am fixing warnings in the C code. I will probably rewrite
the Python interface at some point (this is early).

psfgen is licensed by the University of Illinois' Non-Exclusive, Non-Commercial
use license.

"This software includes code developed by the Theoretical and Computational
Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
