   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

psfgen - python
===============
No one should have to learn TCL to do molecular dynamics simulation setup
or analysis. Psfgen is written entirely in C and has TCL bindings, so I've
added Python bindings too.


Installation
------------
You need a working C compiler. Either Python 2 or 3 will work, but I'd recommend
switching to Python 3 as soon as possible.

    python setup.py install


Usage
-----
